============================================================================
v1.2
	Added changelog file
	Added metacharacter ? meaning any single character (exactly one)
	Added options page!
		temporary disable
		explicit homepage/newtab protection
		one button to add several suggested patterns
		'clear all' button
	Improved icon so its visible on darker themes
	No longer requires * prefix/suffix, instead of matching whole URL it matches a substring
		Automatically removes * prefix/suffix from existing entries on version update (one time only)
	Improved the "page killed" log statement
	Moved storage add/remove out of BG and into balloon and options menu
	Big restructuring/functionalizing in BG script
	NOTE: gave up on auto-detecting homepage/newtab... am able to reliably detect browser, but homepage 
		and newtab are literally inaccessible in Chrome, and the only method available in Firefox prevents 
		Chrome from loading the extension. Because I don't want keep one version that works on both
		browsers I have to give up on this.
	NOTE: in Chrome only, whenever options page or balloon send a message to the BG script, it works 
		perfectly but throws an error in the console. Not sure how to prevent it, very annoying.


v1.1
	Added 'chrome-compat' folder, modified 'manifest.json', modified 'edit_list.html'
	All this adds support for running the exact same extension on Chrome
		Not actually published on Chrome store because I don't want to pay $5
	All credit to the 'webextension polyfill' library: https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill


v1.0
	Basic functionality on Firefox
	Pattern must match entire URL; therefore pattern-list requires * before and after as an any-length wildcard
	Tracks # of hits on each pattern
	When displaying list, sort alphabetically
	Logging statements NOT removed
